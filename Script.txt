Hi, I’m Adam Eubanks, a veteran instructor with over 10,000 students.
 When I first looked at git, I felt intimidated by the terminal and the memorization of commands. Luckily, I was able to overcome these challenges and I created this course to help others who felt as I did. If you are not fully satisfied with this course, udemy and I offer you a 30 day money back guarantee, so you have nothing to risk, but everything to gain from taking this course. Thank you so much for watching and I hope to see you soon!
